      <description>Last year, I took the leap and embarked on a two month digital nomad trip to Portugal. Half of my time was spent on the amazing island of Madeira. It was the most incredible experience, and Portugal was the perfect destination for being a first-time digital nomad. Madeira, specifically the village of Ponta Do Sol is now known the first &amp;lsquo;digital nomad village&amp;rsquo; in the world. It was amazing to be apart of this up-and-coming digital nomad destination.</description>

      <title>Create a Custom Email Domain When GitHub Pages is Your Web Host</title>

      <description>GitHub Pages is an awesome, free way to host a website. This is where my current developer portfolio lives. Although it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple setup, GitHub is lacking a solution to directly configure a custom email domain (for example hi@my.domain rather then helloworld@gmail.com). Even though an email address may seem like a small detail in the larger branding picture, a custom email domain can help enhance your overall brand image and build customer trust.</description>

      <description>This is a simple step-by-step workflow to set up a Shopify Development Environment from the command line. The idea is to keep a similar workflow to other dev environments. A similar workflow would mean managing the theme files locally by making changes and committing those changes with Git while running a command line tool to watch for changes and automatically update the theme on the Shopify store.
This post is a brief primer on setting up your Shopify dev environment.</description>

      <title>Software Craftsmanship</title>

      <description>In a recent interview I was asked to define what &amp;ldquo;software craftsmanship&amp;rdquo; means to me. I felt a sense of relief answering this question. Not only because it was a change of pace from a technical whiteboard question, but I had recently reflected on the similarities between software development and another passion of mine. From my understanding, having craftsmanship is the pursuit of furthering your knowledge and skills towards an activity or passion.</description>

      <title>20 minute rule</title>

      <description>For any new programmers who are starting off at their junior developer position or internship, I have some advice: The 20 Minute Rule (when to ask for help).
When I first started my web development internship at scientist.com, it was a bit overwhelming. Jumping into a massive codebase and making sure you don’t set anything on fire or bring down the company’s online platform had literally given me nightmares. Once I got over that hump, I ran into a new issue I hadn’t faced before.</description>

      <description>Now wishing I would&amp;rsquo;ve started my web dev/designer blog a long time ago! I have a Wordpress music blog, but I wanted to try a new form of blogging for this one.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently launching a separate site specifically for my blog, but in the meantime I will start posting content here on my portfolio site. The blog is being created using Hugo, which is a static site generator and it&amp;rsquo;s being hosted through github pages.</description>
