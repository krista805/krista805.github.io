<p>Last year, I took the leap and embarked on a two month digital nomad trip to Portugal. Half of my time was spent on the amazing island of Madeira. It was the most incredible experience, and Portugal was the perfect destination for being a first-time digital nomad. Madeira, specifically the village of Ponta Do Sol is now known the first &lsquo;digital nomad village&rsquo; in the world. It was amazing to be apart of this up-and-coming digital nomad destination. The island offers a perfect balance between work and leisure. The internet connection is reliable, the safety level is high and the food is delicious and fresh.</p>
<p>As a digital nomad, the freedom to work and travel at the same time is an incredible opportunity. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that short-term digital nomads have different considerations than those who travel long-term. Here are some important things to keep in mind when planning your short-term digital nomad adventure:</p>
<p><strong>1. Accommodation:</strong>
One of the biggest expenses for short-term digital nomads is accommodation. It&rsquo;s important to find a balance between a comfortable living space and an affordable price. Research different options such as hostels, co-living, apartments, or home-sharing services like Airbnb.</p>
<p><strong>2. Internet connection:</strong>
A reliable internet connection is essential for digital nomads. Make sure to research internet options in the area you plan to stay in, and consider purchasing a portable hotspot or SIM card for your phone to ensure you have internet access wherever you go. The island of Madeira has fiber optic internet, so I never had any connectivity issues. In fact, the AirBnb I was staying at had faster internet that I do at home in San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>3. Budget:</strong>
Before embarking on a trip, I recommend creating a budget that covers all expenses, such as accommodation, food, transportation, and any other miscellaneous costs. A useful tool for tracking spending is to make a spreadsheet that includes larger expenses like airfare, car rentals, and accommodations. This allows you to monitor your spending and can be particularly helpful if you are sharing costs with others.</p>
<p><strong>4. Travel insurance:</strong>
Accidents and illnesses can happen at any time, so it&rsquo;s important to have travel insurance to protect yourself. Make sure to research different options and choose a plan that covers the type of travel you&rsquo;ll be doing. I purchased insurance through Heymondo. I chose <strong><a href="https://heymondo.com/" target="_blank">Heymondo</a></strong> because they had an option to include coverage for electronic equipment. They also have 24/7 medical chat, in which you can have a doctor write you a perscription.</p>
<p><strong>5. Work-life balance:</strong>
It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the excitement of traveling, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that you&rsquo;re still working. Make sure to set boundaries and schedule time for both work and play to avoid burnout.

<p><strong>6. Networking:</strong>
Short-term digital nomads have limited time to make connections, so make the most of it. Attend networking events and join local groups to meet other professionals and potential clients in your field. The <strong><a href="https://digitalnomads.startupmadeira.eu/" target="_blank">Digital Nomads Madeira Island</a></strong> had it&rsquo;s own slack channel, so it was easy to connect with other nomads and plan group events (hiking, lunches, go-cart racing)</p>
<p><strong>7. Be flexible:</strong>
Be open to changes and be prepared to adapt to new situations. Short-term digital nomads may encounter unexpected challenges, such as last minute accommodation changes, flight cancellations, or other obstacles.
Research the destination: Research the destination you&rsquo;re planning to go to, this will help you plan your trip better, know what to expect, and be more prepared for the local culture, laws and regulations. Also, research about the availability of coworking spaces and other facilities that you might need for your work.</p>
<p><strong>8. Plan ahead:</strong>
It&rsquo;s important to have a plan for everything, from work to leisure activities. This will help you make the most of your time and avoid wasting it. Planning ahead also helps you to be more organized, and less stressed. Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance!</p>
<p><strong>9. Pack smart:</strong>
As a digital nomad, you&rsquo;ll likely be carrying all of your possessions with you, so it&rsquo;s important to pack smart. I recommend investing in high-quality, waterproof cases for your electronics, especially for your laptop, which should be kept in a protective case when traveling as a carry-on item on the plane. Bring only what you need and leave behind anything that you won&rsquo;t use. This will make it easier to move around and will save you money on baggage fees.

<p>Short-term digital nomadism can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but it&rsquo;s important to be prepared and aware of the challenges that come with it. By considering these important factors, short-term digital nomads can make the most of their adventure while minimizing any potential stresses. Remember to enjoy the journey and make the most out of your short-term digital nomad experience!</p>
