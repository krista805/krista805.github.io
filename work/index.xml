      <description>Agency73 was looking for a branding revamp in order to improve their online presence and upcoming marketing efforts. I redid their whole website, as well as designing marketing materials to send to prospective clients. Their old existing website didn’t clearly communicate their service offering and lacked a personal/appealing look and feel. There weren’t any style guides or design mockups to refer to, so I had the opportunity to drive both the design and development efforts for this project.</description>

      <description>I was tasked to build out a landing page for Honma Golf&amp;rsquo;s marketing efforts. Honma recently re-developed their US eCommerce website and decided to build it on Shopify. They needed a quick solution for their sales reps to send out an email blast to current and prospective clients about their new clubs. Because of the design complexities and number of products they wanted to showcase, we decided to build a landing page template in Shopify vs an HTML email template.</description>

      <description>ARMA is a lifestyle-driven sports nutrition brand for the action and adventure athlete. They came to Agency73 looking for a robust, yet flexible eCommerce store. We suggested using Shopify based on the requirements:
 Ease of use for the client to monitor orders, revenue, and products Ability to integrate a subscription-based model for some of their products Automatically fulfill orders and seamlessly connect to their third party logistics Out-of-box, lightweight eCommerce solution that is well optimized/built for speed Build out 2 separate blogs - one to highlight Arma&amp;rsquo;s sponsors/athletes and another for Recipes and Workouts Configure and implement a promo code input option at the store checkout  Once we received the design assets, I was tasked to build out the entire website.</description>

      <description>Crypto Portfolio Tracker using Vue/Nuxt, bootstrap, and the CoinGecko API.
My main goal for this project was to get a better familiarity with componentization. Although I work primarily on a Vue application for my current job, I am following already established patterns for our components.
The first step I took was to create user stories, divided into two phases. The first phase was user stories required to complete in order to launch.</description>

      <description>I had the opportunity to build out the UI for a marketing anomaly detection project at Agency73. I had previously expressed interest in bettering my skills in a JavaScript framework, and fortunate enough, Agency73 wanted me to code out this project’s UI. We decided to use Vue.JS as the front-end framework.
Without getting into too much into detail, the primary objective of this project was to create a proof of concept machine learning-based tool that would:</description>

      <description>A modern home &amp;amp; sign up design for an iOS App. Created the design based on the web app VolunteerUP, which I previously helped co-develop during my time at LEARN Academy. I wanted to stay consistent with the original app, so I stuck to the same font and color scheme. This is my first iOS app design and surley won&amp;rsquo;t be my last! I used draw.io to create a user flowchart prior to the low-fidelity prototype.</description>

      <description>Weather Watcher is a weather app that will take in a location and produce the degrees in F, the location, weather icon, percentage humidity, windspeed and direction. Depending on the weather (ex. sunny, raining, snow, etc.) a different icon will show each time.
I utilized the OpenWeatherMap Api and added in the ability to have the weather updated by current geographic location rather than inputing a zip code or city. If a user&amp;rsquo;s browser isn&amp;rsquo;t supported by geolocation, then it will prompt the user to manually enter in their zip code.</description>
