                   <p>Agency73 was looking for a branding revamp in order to improve their online presence and upcoming marketing efforts. I redid their whole website, as well as designing marketing materials to send to prospective clients. Their old existing website didn’t clearly communicate their service offering and lacked a personal/appealing look and feel. There weren’t any style guides or design mockups to refer to, so I had the opportunity to drive both the design and development efforts for this project.
