                   <p>ARMA is a lifestyle-driven sports nutrition brand for the action and adventure athlete. They came to Agency73 looking for a robust, yet flexible eCommerce store. We suggested using Shopify based on the requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of use for the client to monitor orders, revenue, and products</li>
<li>Ability to integrate a subscription-based model for some of their products</li>
<li>Automatically fulfill orders and seamlessly connect to their third party logistics</li>
<li>Out-of-box, lightweight eCommerce solution that is well optimized/built for speed</li>
<li>Build out 2 separate blogs - one to highlight Arma&rsquo;s sponsors/athletes and another for Recipes and Workouts</li>
<li>Configure and implement a promo code input option at the store checkout</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we received the design assets, I was tasked to build out the entire website. Since this store was very customized, I utilized a Shopify starter theme, and then implemented ThemeKit so I could streamline the development workflow.

<p>Not only did I handle the build of the Shopify store, but I also led the project management efforts and led weekly status meetings with the client. Sometimes it can be difficult to handle both development and project management for a client, but they were such a joy to work with, it made my job easier!</p>
