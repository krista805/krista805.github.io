                   <p>For a personal project, I decided to build a note-taking application using Vue.js 3, Pinia, Bulma, Firebase, and Vite. This app is designed to help users create, read, update, and delete notes, and all the notes are stored in a Firebase Firestore database. I also included login and register functionality.</p>

<p>I used Vite to set up the project, Pinia for state management, Bulma for styling, and Firebase for real-time database updates. I decided to try out Pinia for state management, despite being more familiar with Vuex.</p>
<p>I developed several components for the note-taking application, including ones for the authentication functionality, displaying the list of notes, and editing a single note. I also created a statistics component that shows the total number of notes and characters in the notes.</p>

<p>Overall, I found that using Vue.js 3, Pinia, Bulma, Firebase, and Vite made it easy to create a note-taking application with CRUD functionality. At first, I was hesitant to switch to a new state management library. However, after creating the Pinia stores in my project, I appreciated the simplicity, organized structure and maintainibility of it.</p>
