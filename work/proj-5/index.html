                   <p>A modern home &amp; sign up design for an iOS App. Created the design based on the web app VolunteerUP, which I previously helped co-develop during my time at LEARN Academy.
I wanted to stay consistent with the original app, so I stuck to the same font and color scheme.
This is my first iOS app design and surley won&rsquo;t be my last! I used draw.io to create a user flowchart prior to the low-fidelity prototype.
Tools: Sketch, draw.io</p>
