                   <p>Weather Watcher is a weather app that will take in a location and produce the degrees in F, the location, weather icon, percentage humidity, windspeed and direction. Depending on the weather (ex. sunny, raining, snow, etc.) a different icon will show each time.</p>
<p>I utilized the OpenWeatherMap Api and added in the ability to have the weather updated by current geographic location rather than inputing a zip code or city. If a user&rsquo;s browser isn&rsquo;t supported by geolocation, then it will prompt the user to manually enter in their zip code.
