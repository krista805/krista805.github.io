                   <p>Crypto Portfolio Tracker using Vue/Nuxt, bootstrap, and the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api">CoinGecko API</a>.</p>
<p>My main goal for this project was to get a better familiarity with componentization. Although I work primarily on a Vue application for my current job, I am following already established patterns for our components.</p>
<p>The first step I took was to create user stories, divided into two phases. The first phase was user stories required to complete in order to launch. The second phase was more &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo;, but not necessary features. I found that dividing it into phases was helpful because it felt feasable to complete a smaller batch of stories. Plus it kept me from spending time on the &lsquo;nice to haves&rsquo;. Once I had the user stories, I mocked a basic wireframe of the UI. Next, I sliced up the wireframe, splitting it into the core components: Portfolio Summary, AssetList, and AssetInput.</p>
<p>Within each component, I created a markdown file with the associated user stories
Here is an example of the AssetList components' markdown file:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a user, I can see a list of the crypto assets I added</li>
<li>I can view the following in the table row
<ul>
<li>Asset name, ticker symbol, crypto logo</li>
<li>Amount in crypto</li>
<li>Current value in USD</li>
<li>Allocation in this asset (based on USD value)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I can filter the table to show my crypto assets by coin name or by USD value</li>
<li>I have the option to delete any crypto I may add to this list</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to componentize everything. It makes it harder to pass data between parent and sibling components</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get caught up in the designs. I put this project off for a while because I didn&rsquo;t have a design implementation.</li>
<li>There are several ways to go about doing things in Vue. Be open to going back and refactoring your code.</li>
</ul>
